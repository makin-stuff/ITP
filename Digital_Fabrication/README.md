# How to populate brain boards

For any version, each brain board consists of a string of 80 addressable LEDs, 40 on the front and 40 on the back. This is the only component used on the whole board!

The addressable LED footprint was designed to be used with [these LEDs I got from Adafruit.](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4957)

The orientation of the LED matters for the brain boards to work, so always double-check before soldering!
If you are building up version 1.0 of these boards (green soldermask) there is a white silkscreen triangle indicator for pin 1 on the LED footprint. Line this silkscreen up with the pin of the LED that also has a triangle cut out of it in the package.
